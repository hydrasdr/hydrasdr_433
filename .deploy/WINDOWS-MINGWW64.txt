# hydrasdr_433 Windows MinGW-W64 build

This build includes the hydrasdr_433 executable with HydraSDR support.
The GCC runtime is statically linked — no extra DLLs needed beyond
those included in this package (libhydrasdr, libusb, OpenSSL).

This build requires a HydraSDR device connected via USB.

## Quick start

To run hydrasdr_433 you have to open Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Windows Terminal,
then type "cd (hydrasdr_433 folder directory, not hydrasdr_433.exe)"
Example: "cd C:\Users\(name)\Downloads\(hydrasdr_433 folder)"
If typed correctly, the command prompt should change to your hydrasdr_433 folder directory,
then type "hydrasdr_433 (option(s))" and enter, hydrasdr_433 will then start running with the options given.

Running the "-F http" option would look like this:
(directory)> hydrasdr_433 -F http
Press enter and hydrasdr_433 should successfully launch.
When it does, go to http://127.0.0.1:8433/
